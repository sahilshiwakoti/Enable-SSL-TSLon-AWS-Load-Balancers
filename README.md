Enabling SSL/TLS on AWS Load Balancers (ALB & NLB)

📌 Lab Overview

This lab walks through configuring SSL/TLS encryption on AWS Application Load Balancers (ALB) and Network Load Balancers (NLB) using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). It demonstrates how secure traffic is handled at different OSI layers and how these designs are applied in real-world cloud architectures.

This lab is suitable for:
	•	AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA)
	•	Cloud Security fundamentals
	•	Real-world enterprise architecture understanding
  
Exam Tip:

Use ALB when you need HTTPS and routing intelligence.
Use NLB when you need TLS with maximum performance.


🏢 Real-World Mapping: Premier Landscape Services

In a cloud migration scenario for Premier Landscape Services:
	•	ALB handles public HTTPS traffic for:
	•	Employee portals
	•	Customer-facing web apps
	•	NLB secures internal service-to-service communication:
	•	Backend APIs
	•	Database access

This design ensures security, scalability, and performance.
